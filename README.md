A much updated version of my very first [home page](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218135102/http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johan/), 
and then the [cool and impressive homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20030105195310/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/johan/research/index.html),
which was the first google hit for that phrase for a long time.  Of course, now it no longer exsists. 

# Me

My current employer is up-to-date on linked in. 
My best contact is this respository name, at gmail, which I imagine is common. 

# This account

Only slightly less pointless than yelling into the void is not sharing useful snippets. 

Thus, please find some partially useful snippets.
